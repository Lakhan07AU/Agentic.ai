# Agentic.ai
Agentic AI–based intelligent planner using topological sorting to generate efficient, dependency-aware learning paths with optimal time allocation.

# 🤖 Agentic AI – Intelligent Topological Planner for Adaptive Learning
📌 Overview

This project implements an Agentic AI–based intelligent planner that helps users efficiently complete multiple subjects within a fixed deadline by following a dependency-aware learning order. The system models subjects as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and applies topological sorting to ensure that each subject is studied only after its prerequisites are completed.

Unlike traditional static planners, this project introduces a goal-oriented Planner Agent that decomposes high-level goals into structured sub-tasks, assigns learning levels, and generates an optimized day-wise schedule.
